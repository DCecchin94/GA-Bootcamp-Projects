14,1,"Have been using the original machine for years and decided (with much excitement) to upgrade to the Vertuo machine as a gift to hubby. The first machine had a terrible taste of plastic that wouldn't dissipate after multiple rinses. We could taste it in the coffee, it was undrinkable. Exchanged the machine for another Vertuo machine hoping that it was a one-off with the first machine. Unfortunately with this machine, after multiple rinse cycles (including long descale cycle with just water) and multiple $$$ undrinkable coffees dumped down the sink, it's the same thing. It's been 5 days and we can still taste the plastic in the coffee. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like throwing the thing out the window (but for the hundreds of dollars spent).

85,1,"After seeing some of the posts here, I got worried that my plan and new machine wasn’t going to work out. I ended up calling and the first rep I talked to seemed to be on shaky ground about the details of what was going on. She told me that the reason why the order was still pending was because they were out of stock on the machine I chose. (Evoluo). She told me they would have to cancel my plan and couldn’t give any answers on when or if it would ever be back in stock. 
(No complaints. Sounds like they’re doing everything they can to get it sorted.) She put me on hold for a long time and I eventually had to disconnect because my toddler started to lose her mind. 

I had my heart set on one for my office so I resigned to just purchase one outright. When I went to the site, I saw that the machine wasn’t out of stock entirely, only out of stock in the color I ordered. 
 I got excited and called back. 

I explained what happened and asked if they could just change the color on order since I didn’t have any color preference.  I placed on hold again but the rep returned with much better news. 

My order was on pending because they were awaiting a shipment to the warehouse that should be there any day. He then stated that I should receive notice in a day or two that my machine had shipped. 

I thought I would share this experience because I almost cancelled my plan which would have put me in the back of the line had the plan option gone live again on the website.

They told me that they don’t start charging the monthly fee recurring until your machine has shipped so you’re not going to be paying the money for a machine you don’t have.  You’re just out the initial payment of credits plus one dollar. 

Now, I know the Evoluo is not the most popular machine so I don’t know if this will apply to the Creatista fandom, but I did want to share another experience and update since I know a lot of you may be wondering. 

They did say only about 100 accounts were impacted by the shortage so they’re finding it easier to address the issue. 

Hope that helps someone anxiously awaiting their new kit.

1,1,"**So, I just got an Illy X9 machine as part of a promo**: $50 for the machine in exchange for buying at least 12 cans of espresso.  That works out to 252 pods.  My total cost, taxes included, came to $285.50 USD.

I ordered a broad selection of pods, have tried three types so far. My thoughts:

* **Packaging is/was a mixed bag.**  The machine seemed to be cushioned okay, the pod cans largely undented... but about 20% of them had their tops on the bottom of the can instead of, well, the top. Weird.  Oh, and the can designs are really lame; it's hard to differentiate one type from another because the titles/descriptors aren't consistent, and are often in small print.  And one particularly odd/interesting thing about the cans: when I opened a couple of them up, **the smell is** ***incredibly awesome***. Like stepping into a coffee roasting place.  At first, this put a smile on my face. But then I realized... hmm, **this suggests that the pods aren't sealed very well** (note that one can't smell *anything* when opening a Nespresso capsule box). I wonder how long the Illy pods will stay fresh :(.  

* **The X9 machine looks and feels painfully cheap.**  I feel bad for anyone that actually paid &gt;$100 for this thing.  Very plasticky look and feel, sharp edges, a water reservoir top that gets stuck 100% of the time when refilling, and the plate holding the espresso cup vibrates so much that I felt compelled to hold the darn cup lest it end up on the counter.  And just obnoxiously prominent branding.  Nespresso machines feel *so* much more refined than this, even the ""low end"" Nespresso machines.  

* **The instructions are annoying.**  They're reasonably clear, but very cumbersome to read; English and Italian are interspersed *line by line*!  Why on earth can't companies just include instruction sets with one language per leaflet? I'll never understand that.  Or heck, in Illy's case, couldn't they have at least divided languages into separate pages?!  

* **Illy e-marketing is... messed up.**  In the 8 days since I bought the X9 machine and 252 capsules... I've gotten *10* emails from Illy begging me to buy a machine and Illy capsules.  What. The. Fork.   

* **The actual espresso varies.**  I'd rate the decaf I tried (well, Illy's only IperEspresso decaf) as slightly tastier, more authentically espresso'ish than the Nespresso decaf pods I've enjoyed in the past; definitely stronger, though that may be because of the **surprisingly smaller pull** compared to the Nespresso default \[see [bspooky's interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/a1x8s8/nespresso_shot_size_vs_illysand_what_is_your/) for more details!\]. The ""lungo"" shot (about the same volume as Nespresso's ""espresso"" size) tasted weak and uninspiring.  The regular Illy shot I tried (Brazil variety) was... fine. While closer to ""real"" espresso in texture and strength, IMHO, I didn't find it especially delicious.  

* **No recycling bag?**  I expected that I'd get a postage-paid mailer with my 252 capsules, but... nope :(.  I'm gonna call Illy on Monday to request one, keeping fingers crossed.  And I will be gobsmacked if they either refuse to send one or insist on payment.  

* W**here can I taste / buy / recycle capsules in person?!**  The [Illy locator page](https://www.illy.com/en-us/company/store-events/locator) suggests just one place *in the entire United States* (a restaurant near my home that serves Illy coffee) when I zoom out. That can't be right. 

**In retrospect, I regret investing so much money and countertop space with Illy.**  And frankly, I have mostly myself to blame.  I should have explored the possibility of sampling the espressos or at least seeing a machine in person before jumping in.  The very marginal stronger/better espresso taste &amp; texture just doesn't seem to be a worthy tradeoff for the hassles (dealing with two capsule ecosystems, dealing with tasting/recycling logistics/etc.).  And at 90 cents per small ristretto-sized espresso (meaning I'll basically need *2* shots each morning), Illy espresso is more than *twice as expensive* per day as Nespresso.  Bummed and disappointed :-(.

* **The instructions are annoying.**  They're reasonably clear, but very cumbersome to read; English and Italian are interspersed *line by line*!  Why on earth can't companies just include instruction sets with one language per leaflet? I'll never understand that.  Or heck, in Illy's case, couldn't they have at least divided languages into separate pages?!  

* **Illy e-marketing is... messed up.**  In the 8 days since I bought the X9 machine and 252 capsules... I've gotten *10* emails from Illy begging me to buy a machine and Illy capsules.  What. The. Fork.   

* **The actual espresso varies.**  I'd rate the decaf I tried (well, Illy's only IperEspresso decaf) as slightly tastier, more authentically espresso'ish than the Nespresso decaf pods I've enjoyed in the past; definitely stronger, though that may be because of the **surprisingly smaller pull** compared to the Nespresso default \[see [bspooky's interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/a1x8s8/nespresso_shot_size_vs_illysand_what_is_your/) for more details!\]. The ""lungo"" shot (about the same volume as Nespresso's ""espresso"" size) tasted weak and uninspiring.  The regular Illy shot I tried (Brazil variety) was... fine. While closer to ""real"" espresso in texture and strength, IMHO, I didn't find it especially delicious.  

* **No recycling bag?**  I expected that I'd get a postage-paid mailer with my 252 capsules, but... nope :(.  I'm gonna call Illy on Monday to request one, keeping fingers crossed.  And I will be gobsmacked if they either refuse to send one or insist on payment.  

* W**here can I taste / buy / recycle capsules in person?!**  The [Illy locator page](https://www.illy.com/en-us/company/store-events/locator) suggests just one place *in the entire United States* (a restaurant near my home that serves Illy coffee) when I zoom out. That can't be right. 

**In retrospect, I regret investing so much money and countertop space with Illy.**  And frankly, I have mostly myself to blame.  I should have explored the possibility of sampling the espressos or at least seeing a machine in person before jumping in.  The very marginal stronger/better espresso taste &amp; texture just doesn't seem to be a worthy tradeoff for the hassles (dealing with two capsule ecosystems, dealing with tasting/recycling logistics/etc.).  And at 90 cents per small ristretto-sized espresso (meaning I'll basically need *2* shots each morning), Illy espresso is more than *twice as expensive* per day as Nespresso.  Bummed and disappointed :-(.

Caffeine content of Nespresso® pod coffee
Ben Desbrow, Susan Hall, Christopher Irwin
First Published November 5, 2018 Research Article 

ABSTRACT: 
Abstract
Background:
Little independent information on the caffeine content of the popular Nespresso® coffee pod range exists.
Aim:
To quantify the caffeine content of Nespresso® pod coffees.
Methods:
Initially, three serves (ristretto (S), espresso (M), lungo (L)) of two pod varieties (Livanto and Roma) were prepared on three different Nespresso® machines (2 × U-Delonghi (1 × 5 years since purchase (old), 1 × recently purchased (new)), 1 × new Lattissima Pro (alternate)) using two different batches (sleeves). Caffeine content was then determined via triplicate samples using high-performance liquid chromatography. Differences in content (i.e. serve size, machine or sleeve) were determined via an analysis of variance or paired sample t-tests.
Results:
Coffees prepared on different machines or pods from different sleeves did not influence the caffeine content (old = 63 ± 13, new = 60 ± 8, alternate = 60 ± 10 mg·serve–1; p = 0.537, sleeveA = 63 ± 11, sleeveB = 59 ± 9 mg·serve–1; p = 0.134). Less caffeine was delivered in S (51 ± 7 mg·serve–1) compared to larger sizes (M = 66 ± 7 and L = 66 ± 10 mg·serve–1). Subsequently, the caffeine content from two serve sizes (S and L) from 17 other varieties within the Nespresso® range was determined and compared to the manufacturer’s values. Caffeine content (all pods) ranged from 19 to 147 mg·serve–1, and represented 51–162% of manufacturer’s values.
Conclusion:
Nespresso® consumers are exposed to variable amounts of caffeine, which often differ from the manufacturer’s reports",New Research: Nespresso caffeine content,"Just found this recently published scientific paper (2018.11.08).

18,1,"I've gotten so much information from r/Nepresso that I thought I'd take a minute and write down my experience.

Why I bought- I stay in hotels a lot and in US hotels the coffee is terrible.  I have come up with some work arounds (Starbucks Via and bottles of Cold Brew) but after staying at a JW Marriott suite with a Vertuo, I was sold.  I purchased the Nespresso to mainly serve as a travel machine as I make really go drip coffee at home and am not giving that up. I also love the cappuccino that I have had in Europe and have been unable to find one in the US.

Original Line or Vertuo- I thought long and hard about whether I should buy an Original Line or Vertuo.  I ultimately decided on the Essenza Mini because of the portability of the machine and because I didn't want to fall into the trap of making cups of coffee every morning in the Vertuo at $1.20 a pop for everyone in the house.  If I lived alone I would buy a Vertuo as well because one cup of brewed coffee would be enough. I was very pleased with the Vertuo that was in our hotel room and if you want cups of coffee, I would definitely recommend it.

Essenza Mini- I decided on the DeLonghi machine because I preferred the styling and I wanted a red machine. For travel the Breville would probably work better because of the boxy shape.  I travel mostly by car, so I just slip the machine and the 'ccino in a sturdy canvas tote with capsules in a container and go. The small capacity of the water tank and the used capsule collecter do not bother me, as I don't use multiple capsules a day.  I does release more dripping water than I anticipated, but I just plan for it.

Purchasing- I purchased on Amazon because I had credit and the very few chains that sell in B&amp;M did not carry the Essenza that I wanted.  I first purchased an open box to save money and it came without the drip pan and in the wrong color. It also came with a bag of sample capsules which was not very helpful because it didn't have the box with descriptions. I returned it and would not recommend purchasing that way to save money.

Stores- I went out of my way to visit a nano boutique in Charlotte, NC.  They only were sampling Vertuo and had no capsules of any type on hand.  I visited Sur La Table at the same mall and they were so kind and gave me a few capsules when I explained I was in town and about out of capsules. 

Capsules- This was the cause of many hours of consternation.  I took the advice of the kind folks here and took notes.   
 I kept it very simple by marking with a check mark on the sample box which ones I wanted to buy and which ones I didn't like as much.  

Second party capsules- Since I ended up buying very close to a trip, I needed to purchase second party capsules to have some coffee in my room.  I was shocked to find out that I agree with the sub and the Nespresso brand are better. I would rebuy the Target brand in a pinch, but don't ever plan on needing to do so.  I was able to get the packages down to about 35 cents a capsule with a sale they were running and would recommend trying them because the price difference is huge and you never know.  I also tried Private Selection Ristretto (Kroger) and did not like the taste.

First order- I decided to place my first order using the promo code that gave me 2 free sleeves.  I wanted to purchase those varieties anyway.  I may go back and get the welcome package, but I have a strong preference for darker roasts but I've begun to enjoy the lighter ones as well.

Favorites- Roma is the favorite of all of my family for making Cappuccinos that taste like a corner coffee store in Europe.  I really enjoy the Macaron for a treat and I don't normally like flavored coffee.  It has a nice pleasant marzipan flavor.  Livanto surprised me as it isn't super intense. I was surprised that Ristretto is not a favorite.  I like Arpeggio decaf quite a bit.  I found that if you like a larger drink that Dharkan holds up to using more water and thus producing more coffee.

Resellers- My thanksgiving hosts offered to buy some capsules if I would bring my machine and they bought a five sleeve pack from amazon. It came fine, except there was some minor denting. It wasn't cheaper, but good to order a smaller quantity quickly.

Now you can also know me as *NespressoSemiTraitorGuy*. That's right, my caffeinated friends, since at least a few of us are polyamorous with our coffee sources, I'm gonna show you how to get an Illy machine + coffee for a steep discount :-).

1. Go through [Ebates.com](https://www.ebates.com/illy.com?query=illy&amp;position=1&amp;type=suggest&amp;store=9714) for 14% cash back. If you're not already an Ebates member, you can get a $10 new member bonus via [my referral link](https://www.ebates.com/r/968918?eeid=28187) (and -- disclaimer -- I also get a referral bonus). I believe this high % back is temporary (perhaps just for Black Friday?).
2. Click through to Illy's site from Ebates.  Then on Illy's site, click on the ""Free machine"" link in the header.    
NOTE:  Yeah, Illy's *always* offering ""free machines"" but in this case, the required capsule purchase is *substantially* smaller than usual (12 cans of 21 capsules each; I think it's usually 20 cans).
3. Follow the instructions; select a machine, select capsules, checkout!

**Additional notes:**

* Reviews on Amazon for most of the machines seem to be largely negative.  In summary: great coffee, terrible machine reliability, horrible Illy customer service.  Caveat emptor :(.
* The X9 machine, which I'm thinking of getting myself, has only 2 reviews on Amazon (both positive) but gets positive reviews elsewhere on the interwebs, so I'm cautiously optimistic.  Note that it makes only espresso, not coffee (in contrast with some of the other machines offered as part of this special), and it has a $50 upcharge vs. the $0 price of a couple of the other machines.
* I've read at least one person who claims that their machine arrived much earlier than the capsules :\\.

**So in all, it sounds like this is likely to be a highly discounted, very tasty, but possibly very frustrating experience.**

It's also a rather silly one for me, frankly. I already have four Nespresso machines (have unsuccessfully tried to sell some of them already), three Nespresso frothers (barely use any of them), and 100+ pods... going through them at the rate of about 5 a week.  So with 252 capsules from Illy... I'll be set for, er, over a year.  And since I'm dyin' to try some of the new Nespresso pods (Paris Black!), probably make that two years.  I hope these lil things really *do* stay fresh nearly indefinitely. Or I may have to make some local Nespresso'ing friends very happy.  Or just start having espresso parties at my house.  Or both.

I've read posts where people have reused the old pods with pre-cut foils or made their own but cutting up kitchen foil. When I check Amazon, I'm mostly seeing foils for vertuo pods. My Cap has a foil set that goes with reusable pods or this interesting coffee filter/plastic weight set that looks like it would fall apart the moment I dropped it in my machine. Have no problem DIY-ing or buying a suggested set. Just not sure how to get started and trust the feedback here over Amazon reviews. 

Also willing to be told this is a terrible idea and just use our french press for the Kona :)

18,1,"I got a VertuoLine Evoluo machine a few months ago, after discovering Nespresso on a Paris trip, and love it. I’ve been experimenting with refilling the pods with my own coffee. Results have been...inconsistent. Sometimes everything is great; sometimes the machine sounds like it’s going to explode :/

I’ve watched a few videos. I believe someone on here had a great recommendation to utilize an outer and inner pod, the latter containing the actual coffee and having the edges trimmed off. I use a Baratza Virtuoso grinder. The espresso range is 2 to 6, so I’ve been grinding on 6 (on the coarser side). I started off this way, lightly packing in the coffee to fit more. I then use a combination of aluminum foil and Cling Wrap to seal the pod before inserting into an outer pod. 

Should I be packing down the coffee, or should I just fit in as much as I naturally can? Videos seem mixed on this. I figure one thing I may be doing wrong is packing too much, clogging the unit? Also, comparing my ground coffee to that originally in a pod, my grind isn’t as fine. So perhaps I need to grind at 2 or 4? But wouldn’t a finer grind mean more of a chance to clog, since water wouldn’t pass through the coffee as easily, compared to a more coarse grind? 

If anyone cares to share their methodology, I’m all ears! Thanks.

39,1,"I love my Nespresso, but I became a fan kinda by chance. You see, it was 2014, and at the time, I had a hobby of flipping deals I found online and selling them on Amazon. One day I notice a deal for Nespresso - the Pixie bundle - with the milk frother, for $199 from Macy's, which also included a $100 credit to Nespresso. There was a limit of 5 credits per person, so I ordered 5 machines for $995 + tax. 

Now I have 5 bundles and $500 credit. 1 of the bundles didn't ship for a month, Macy's ended up giving me a $100 gift card, AND ended up shipping the bundle.

I like coffee, so I figure I will keep 1 bundle for myself, take all the credit, and flip the rest. I waited out the promo period and quickly sold the 4 bundles on Amazon at a decent markup, making a little profit + $500 credit + $100 Macy's gift card. I had all year to use the credit which was nice, and I managed to spend it all in time for the next promo in 2015.

2015 holiday promo arrived and it was a bit of a let down. For one, Nespresso lowered the credit amount to $75, and 2nd, they only allowed the credit to be used for 3-4 months. Even if I can find a deal worth flipping, how much coffee do I want to stock up on? I figured I will wait for a deal and see what's worth flipping. I ended up finding the Chrome Vertuoline on sale for a great price - $118.99 on Amazon, which was eligible for the $75 credit. I bought 5, and a few days later figured, my wife can buy another 5. So we bought another 5 at $139.99, paying an average of $129.49 per machine and selling it at an average of $200+, netting $30+ per sale while also generating $750 worth of Nespresso credit. Not bad for a little work. (Side story: After buying the Chrome Vertuoline, the Red Vertuoline went on sale at Amazon for $109.99 with a lot in stock. The Red model didn't have good resale value, but the low price was preventing me from unloading my Chrome units. So I posted the deal on Slickdeals, mentioning the $75 credit, and within a few hours Amazon sold out of 650 units :-)

I now have $750 of credit, but need to use it before March. I looked around the site, and figured out that I could buy Nespresso gift cards with my credit, thereby ensuring that I can buy fresh Nespresso as I pleased.

The Red model didn't have good resale value, but the low price was preventing me from unloading my Chrome units. So I posted the deal on Slickdeals, mentioning the $75 credit, and within a few hours Amazon sold out of 650 units :-)

I now have $750 of credit, but need to use it before March. I looked around the site, and figured out that I could buy Nespresso gift cards with my credit, thereby ensuring that I can buy fresh Nespresso as I pleased. Took me a while to use up that credit, and they haven't run a promo like it again...it stings to actually pay for coffee these days lol.Revisiting Some Wild Nespresso Deals I Took Advantage of"

I was going to pull the trigger on a Vertuoline with Aeroccino bundle, but then I realized that all I make are capuccinos or lattes. I read some more and the general consensus seems to be that the original line machine makes better espresso.

That said, here are my options:

Brand new Vertuoline and an Aeroccino 3 for $125

Slightly used Inissia and Aeroccino for $60

Any considerations when looking at used machines? Should I avoid then completely?

0,1,"Hi all,

I've decided to create a thread to compile a list of all active deals for Nespresso -- site coupons, machine sales, etc. I think we should limit this to Nespresso and their retail partners just to prevent junk like random Ebay deals or sketchy Amazon sellers cluttering up the thread.

I know in the past it's been pretty hit or miss as to whether or not Nespresso actually e-mails you about active promotions. This way people can be aware of every deal that's currently available, even if they weren't targeted by the marketing campaign.

I'd like new people to be able to come here to find a good deal on their first machine, or for current Nespresso owners to find a coupon code to use when re-ordering capsules.

I will keep this updated with any deals that I receive, but please share anything you know of if it's not already listed. Be sure to specify your region because any promotions will be region specific, and also provide the time frame that the deal is active (usually located in the fine print of any e-mails). If a deal has expired, let me know and I will remove it.

Thanks!

Nespresso taste test– how we did it   

For our 2018 Nespresso taste tests, we tested 22 different coffee capsules, including four from Nespresso, 11 high-street Nespresso-compatible pods, and seven pods from online coffee specialists. We focused on the bestselling products, and coffees that were full-bodied and intense – suitable for making espresso or a short-style coffee. Our panel of four independent coffee experts included: 

Giles Hilton – panel head, coffee specialist with 40 years’ tasting experience 

Colin Smith –  coffee roaster and former president of the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe 

Charles Love – tea and coffee product expert and trainer 

Charles Metcalfe  – expert taster, Master of Wine and co-chair of the International Wine Challange 

We made dozens of espressos using a Which? Best Buy capsule coffee machine and asked our experts to sniff, slurp and taste them all (with and without milk) in a blind tasting, before giving us their verdicts. Each one was given a rating for aroma, flavour, overall appearance and crema (the golden foam found on top).

I see older machines have a ristretto option that is sadly missing from my Touch. Mine has only espresso and lungi.

At the consumer end of the supply chain, used coffee grounds are the most visible example of this waste, the bit we dump in the bin after making each fresh brew.

...

“When it comes to coffee, Dajian notes that only a small fraction of the material used and produced by the industry ends up in the cup; the remainder, from the skin of the coffee cherry at origin to the grounds left after brewing, ends up as waste. Reducing this massive output of waste, and ultimately achieving a true circular economy, will take decades of work and the efforts of many — from entrepreneurs and scientists to coffee roasters and coffee lovers — but the tide does seem to be turning.”

The way I see it is, recycling pods for them is cost cutting &amp; profit increasing method. Win-Win situation for Nespresso.

Nespresso sends all the recycled pods to a warehouse (probably a 3rd party vendor - for $$), who separates aluminum and coffee grounds.  Than this 3rd party vendor sends the aluminum to a different recycling facilities (again selling the aluminum scrap to someone else for $$).  For coffee grounds, they  go through the process and once it is cured at the end they sell the compose to gardening centers and farmers for $$.  

If I was a giant corporation, I wouldn't want to take the overhead of recycling this pods myself so what I would do is, collect pods from customers, sell the pods to recycling companies in pallets.

20,1,"Let me count the ways (and apologies to those of you who've already seen pieces of this rant in other threads)

1. **Bad product labeling:**  When inside the sleeves with the colored (dome) side facing out, the vertuo capsule name is not visible.  The sleeves themselves also have no indication of the name whatsoever.  How hard would it have been to print the name on the ends of the sleeve and on both sides of the pods? (I'm using the 3-sleeve-based stand)
2. **Bad product labeling 2:**  The name printed on the foil is hard to read.  Why not black printing?!
3. **Bad customer support:**  A phone rep tried to offer technical support on my Nespresso Expert.  After an hour, no progress.  And I never got the promised callback.  When I pinged Nespresso Support again, I was told, ""Take the machine back to the store where you bought it"" (but the store had no more in stock).
4. **Bad customer support2:**  I got a used Vertuo machine, but wasn't sure what pods I'd like.  Tried to find a sampler pack on [Nespresso.com](https://Nespresso.com)... nothing under $100. Emailed Nespresso, they said ""Go to a nearby boutique.""  Went there, the boutique asked, ""Have you tried contacting Nespresso? They should be able to send you a welcome pack!""  Luckily I was also able to try a few options at the boutique but... what about the people who don't live near one?! I was honestly tempted to just resell / give away the Vertuo due to the hassle.
5. **Customer-unfriendly practices:**  Nespresso could pretty easily offer mix-and-match options for capsules (even for a slight upcharge), but they don't.
6. **Customer-unfriendly practices2:**  The high minimum for free shipping, combined with the definitely-more-than-postage fee of $7 for &lt;$50 orders discourages impulse buys. There are many times in which I thought, hey, I want to try a sleeve of \[whatever\], but basically now I just forgo it.  
7. **Lousy site design:**  Check out [this page](https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/vertuo) and note the brew size icons.  They're not level, they're hard to figure out at a glance, and they have no mouseover text. Designing more clear icons would seemingly be fairly straightforward.  And I could go on for a while about other site issues, such as...
8. **Inconsistent information:**  The Nespresso Taiwan site includes a lot more information about each capsule than the other sites do.

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically, Nespresso makes it inconvenient to order, difficult to identify the capsules, and hard to get quality product support.  I've seriously been frustrated enough over these last months to consider just abandoning the whole Nespresso ecosystem.  Only three (albeit important) good points:

1. The espressos taste good.
2. They're convenient to brew.
3. The Nespresso rep at the boutique (Sur La Table, Palo Alto) was friendly and helpful.

I would love to see Nespresso get some truly good easy-espresso competition in the U.S. market!  Hopefully that would push them to up their game in so many ways.

They're not level, they're hard to figure out at a glance, and they have no mouseover text. Designing more clear icons would seemingly be fairly straightforward.  And I could go on for a while about other site issues, such as...
8. **Inconsistent information:**  The Nespresso Taiwan site includes a lot more information about each capsule than the other sites do.

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically, Nespresso makes it inconvenient to order, difficult to identify the capsules, and hard to get quality product support.  I've seriously been frustrated enough over these last months to consider just abandoning the whole Nespresso ecosystem.  Only three (albeit important) good points:

1. The espressos taste good.
2. They're convenient to brew.
3. The Nespresso rep at the boutique (Sur La Table, Palo Alto) was friendly and helpful.

I would love to see Nespresso get some truly good easy-espresso competition in the U.S. market!  Hopefully that would push them to up their game in so many ways.

Nespresso

Pros:

Convienece of dropping a pod in and makes consistent coffee. This is a major plus for me. Possible to use my own coffee with a reusable pod? I like the espresso idea, can make more variety of drinks like Americano, latte, etc.

Cons:

Genuine pods can only be bought online with minimum 50 order. Cost of around 90 cents per pod is a little steep. 

BV1500TS

Pros:

Can actually use my Burr grinder, can make multiple cups at a time, quite a bit cheaper. Good quality and highly rated automatic drip machine. Costs less than the Nespresso inissa

Cons:

Don't have a kitchen scale to measure coffee, not as consistent, more of a learning curve",BV1500TS Coffee Machine vs. Nespresso,"First of all, I want quick conviently made consistent coffee in the morning.

For the Creatista I have tried the strongest capsules kazar and darkhan and it's ridiculous. Like I said: It's like I am drinking sugary milk lol. I use the espresso volume for them since I know they have less coffee than the Lavazza pods and use less milk. No go. I use the pre-set and nope. 

Is there a hack to make my lattes and capuccinos as before strong and rich...as in can I make a decent latte or cappuccino or am I out of luck?

47,1,"I ordered the Archer Farms (Target house brand) nespresso pods since they were $5 for 10 pods. They also had a buy 3 get a $5 Target giftcard so you could get 30 pods for $10. 

I am by no means a coffee expert, I am not knowledgeable about coffee, and I am not a coffee snob, so these are the  impressions of a regular guy. 

First of all my favorite pod, and go-to brew, is the Vivalto Lungo from Nespresso. This makes the perfect cup for me and I usually have 2-4 of these a day. I have yet to find one that I enjoy as much as that one and I have tried all the Nespresso capsules and the Trader Joes capsules. 

At Target.com I ordered the Festoso Lungo, the Concerto Organic, and the Legato Lungo. I brewed 2 shots of each. 

The first one I tried was the Festoso, it turned out to be my least favorite of the three. I would say it is very similar to the Trader Joes capsules which I did not care for. It wasn't awful and made a serviceable cup but I would not order it again. I wasn't getting as much coffee taste as I wanted and it didnt seem to have as much crema. I would give it a 5/10. 

The second I tried was the Legato. This capsule was super odd. The capsule, although it looked the same as the others, dropped right through my machine. I put it back in and the pour took a VERY long time. I actually hit the button on the machine to turn it off. I thought it may be an anomaly so I put in a second capsule, this one also took a VERY long time to brew. I let the machine go and it did eventually turn off and didnt seem to pour a larger amount than normal. The espresso was just coming out very slow compared to other capsules. I have never had this happen with any other capsules before. The taste was actually pretty good. Not my favorite but a solid 7/10 and decent amount of crema. 

The third one, Concerto, was the best for me. No problems with the capsule and it had a fairly rich full flavor(to me). I would give it an 8.5/10 and it had a decent amount of crema.  

In the end I am probably going to stick with the Vivalto Lungo even though it costs more, but I will keep looking for cheaper option that matches the taste.",Archer Farms Pods Impressions,"I ordered the Archer Farms (Target house brand) nespresso pods since they were $5 for 10 pods.

I have an acquaintance who swears by his Pixie, but it’s more expensive and I think this will get pretty low use so the Essenza mini seems like a better value. I don’t feel comfortable inviting myself to his house to see it! Does it have a handle or is the thing that looks like a handle decorative?

Input appreciated.

Nope.

Oh, then I guess we'll be getting a whole new milk jug.

Nope.

60,1,I’m not sure what’s happened to Nespresso’s supply chain here in the U.S.  A few years ago I never had problems ordering coffee from their website. I then switched to picking them up at a local Sur La Table when we moved to Northern CA but now we’ve moved again and there isn’t a boutique around. The last 2 orders I’ve placed have had issues. The first order arrived and I only received 2 sleeves out of 5. Today I open the box addressed to me and it’s someone else’s order that lives in Las Vegas! Each time I had to spend 30 mins on the phone with customer support to replace the missing items. I really like the brand and products but if it’s going to be this much of a pain when I need new capsules I’ll just have to switch.

62,1,"He said that the milk frother doesn't work (it doesn't, but will sometimes sporadically work ~1/30 times) and he's sent it into Nespresso multiple times and they've failed to fix it. He was fed up with it, so he just let me have it. I assume the warranty is either out or very close to being out.

I tried googling some troubleshooting tips, but wasn't able to find much. 

The symptoms:

* milk frother/cleaning milk frother doesn't work
* hot water spout doesn't work
* descaling doesn't work
* making espresso works

And when I say ""doesn't work,"" I mean that there is no reaction from the machine. On the touch screen, the button registers that I've touched the option, but there are no noises/anything when I try to produce hot water/milk froth/descaling. 

Any ideas on what I could do to fix it?

76,1,"Hello Fellow Nespresso Drinkers,

I am wondering if anyone has any advice on getting better service from Nespresso (or perhaps some input if people think I'm crazy and need to take whats being offered to me!) after what I would say has been just an awful time with Nespresso Canada. To keep it short

- Bought Latissima Plus in 2015, have had no issues
- Minor break occurs in mid Sept (cover plate fell of, exposing internal components)
- Claim filed ~ Sept 20, Nespresso says a loaner will be sent
- Week later, no loaner machine has arrived, call to Nespresso and I realize they sent my machine to an address in another city....Which is located on an Island... Across a body of water from my current home (ironically, I lived there before I owned a Nespresso, or even drank any coffee!)
- Unhelpful CSR has no clue how they got that address, nor does he seem to care. He ships another loaner to me.
- Unfortunately he forgets to my include the unit number of my current address, so UPS can't deliver it and its just before a weekend where we are heading out of town. More delays!
- Finally, I get a loaner, package up my machine and ship it back to the Nespresso repair centre (which, ironically enough, is located in about a 30 min drive from where I live!)

And then crickets for about 5 weeks. I'm a patient guy, so I wait. Finally call Nespresso on Nov 4, can't get through so I email. I get a response, with the CSR promising to look into it the next day and assuring me a call back from her.... Which never comes. Wash, rinse and repeat this entire dog and pony show for about 7 days via email and phone. A very empathetic CSR does some digging, says something isn't right with the claim status, and tells me she will have a supervisor call me the next day. No call from the supervisor comes :(

I call/email, get told to provide the best times to call over the next three business days. I provide very larges windows (""Afternoons after 12pm are great!"") to call. And surprise, surprise... No one calls.

Finally, a few days ago, I had had enough. Called Nespresso, was told there were no supervisors around but my claim status had been updated! The CRS's computer showed that my machine had been shipped (thank god!!!!) and delivered (uhh???) to the same old address they had shipped the loaner machine too (...)

I couldn't make this shit up if I tried. Amazingly, a supervisor was able to call me back only a few hours later after the goof was discovered. Was he helpful? Moderately so, but not meaningfully. He offered to replace the machine Nespresso lost with the same machine, but refused to offer anything for the circus Nespresso has put me through. As a goodwill gesture he offered to allow me to put the value of the replacement machine ($500) as a credit towards the new Creatista machine that my wife and I had been considering upgrading to before this episode started. I wasn't exactly jumping at his offers, and countered that I'd like the Creatista fully paid for, or that I'd prefer to be refunded on my lost machine and unused pods so I can buy a non-Nespresso machine. He said he would escalate further and to expect a call.

The next supervisor my wife spoke with rescinded the full credit offer, only giving her the option to put part the cost of the replacement towards the new machine ($300), and that the replacing the machine was generous enough! While they were chatting, the call dropped. I called the supervisor back at his supposed ""direct"" ext right away, but was told there he wasn't available (no supervisors were available) and that supervisor would call me back the next business day :)

And this is where I stand. A lost Nespresso Latissima Plus, a boatload of Pods that will leave an undeniably sour taste in my mouth, and no satisfying response from Nepresso Canada.

Is this a case of utter incompetence and tone-deaf service on Nespresso's part? Or am I asking for too much?

TL/dr: Nespresso lost my machine after I sent it in to be fixed under warranty; its been a comedy of errors on their part for the past 10 weeks or so; not happy with their current offer on the table and am not sure what my options are.

Basically, if you have Bluetooth headphones or AirPods, you will experience frame drops if you’re connected to them while watching a video. This is a problem within iOS itself, as I’ve tried multiple different phones, different headphones and different iOS versions. (It’s also iOS wide, not linked to the YouTube app specifically.) I hope the developers of iOS can come to attention about this issue and fix it ASAP as it very much degrades the apple experience. 


Here are steps to reproduce this issue very easily: 

1) Download the YouTube app if you do not have it
2) Disconnect bluetooth
3) Watch a video that has 60 FPS, I suggest a video on a video game. [This video is the best way to produce this issue.](https://youtu.be/eoGx5GRbSfM) (make sure to open the video in the YouTube app) 
4) Watch the video (make sure highest quality possible) for a bit, you can skip around. Take note of how smooth it is
5) connect your Bluetooth headphones and unpause the video, you should be able to instantly see the frame loss
6) if you still can’t tell, watch the video with your Bluetooth headphones, skip around and then turn them off and unpause the video, you will see the video has become much more smooth. 


If you experience this issue on your iPhone, or other iOS device, I urge you to send feedback with the rest of us as I believe that will be the only way we can get the developers to notice. 

You can send feedback [here.](https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html)
Below I will create a template you can use for the comment section in the feedback, feel free to change it if you’d like. 

____________________________________________
Subject: Bluetooth video frame loss 

Feedback type: Performance 

Comments: 

Whenever you connect a Bluetooth audio device to your iOS device, you will experience a frameloss up to it seems 30 frames. 

Example: If you’re watching a video (especially a video game gameplay) with the iPhone’s speakers you will experience it in a smooth 60 frames. However,  when you connect your Bluetooth device (headphones for example), you will notice significant lag and frame drop in the video. 

Steps to reproduce: 
1) Watch video gameplay on YouTube app in 60 FPS
2) connect Bluetooth headphones after a while and you will see reduced frames, which degrades the user experience greatly. 

Thank you, I hope you can fix this bug quickly.

This is a problem within iOS itself, as I’ve tried multiple different phones, different headphones and different iOS versions. (It’s also iOS wide, not linked to the YouTube app specifically.) I hope the developers of iOS can come to attention about this issue and fix it ASAP as it very much degrades the apple experience. 


Here are steps to reproduce this issue very easily: 

1) Download the YouTube app if you do not have it
2) Disconnect bluetooth
3) Watch a video that has 60 FPS, I suggest a video on a video game. [This video is the best way to produce this issue.](https://youtu.be/eoGx5GRbSfM) (make sure to open the video in the YouTube app) 
4) Watch the video (make sure highest quality possible) for a bit, you can skip around. Take note of how smooth it is
5) connect your Bluetooth headphones and unpause the video, you should be able to instantly see the frame loss
6) if you still can’t tell, watch the video with your Bluetooth headphones, skip around and then turn them off and unpause the video, you will see the video has become much more smooth. 


If you experience this issue on your iPhone, or other iOS device, I urge you to send feedback with the rest of us as I believe that will be the only way we can get the developers to notice. 

You can send feedback [here.](https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html)
Below I will create a template you can use for the comment section in the feedback, feel free to change it if you’d like. 

____________________________________________
Subject: Bluetooth video frame loss 

Feedback type: Performance 

Comments: 

Whenever you connect a Bluetooth audio device to your iOS device, you will experience a frameloss up to it seems 30 frames. 

Example: If you’re watching a video (especially a video game gameplay) with the iPhone’s speakers you will experience it in a smooth 60 frames. However,  when you connect your Bluetooth device (headphones for example), you will notice significant lag and frame drop in the video. 

Steps to reproduce: 
1) Watch video gameplay on YouTube app in 60 FPS
2) connect Bluetooth headphones after a while and you will see reduced frames, which degrades the user experience greatly. 

Thank you, I hope you can fix this bug quickly.

When I'm driving, sometimes Siri will refuse to do things for me unless I unlock my iPhone first. These things are inconsistent. Sometimes it won't call people unless I unlock my iPhone. Or give me directions. Or skip a track.

When I'm driving, sometimes Siri will refuse to do things for me unless I unlock my iPhone first. These things are inconsistent. Sometimes it won't call people unless I unlock my iPhone. Or give me directions. Or skip a track.

17,0,"SPOILER: It all ended well - but below my expectations from Apple Customer Support. 

SHORT VERSION:
I’m very satisfied with Apple products but honestly disappointed with Apple Support. It took many days and long calls to finally get my lost in shipment Apple Pencil and have it registered with AppleCare+. The first line of contact was not competent with the second line that was able to help. In comparison Amazon also has misplaced my orders but it took just two emails to solve the problem and I got my products on the way. Such simple logistic issues as lost product ordered from Online Apple Store should be more automatic and easier for customer. Apple should be alerted by shipping company that shipment was lost and take steps to solve the issue. I had impression as if I was alone at finding out what happened to a product I paid for and was lost. 

LONGER STORY:
On December 3rd I ordered on Apple Online Store in Sweden “the whole set”: iPad Pro 12.9” 256, Apple Keyboard Portfolio, USB-USB C, USB-SD Card adapters, Apple Pencil, AppleCare+, price about 2000€. Initial shipment containing two items iPad and Apple Pencil from The Netherlands through Germany went very fast sent on 5th and arrived on 6th in Stockholm Airport. I live nearby Stockholm so was expecting it soon but still had to wait one week (normally about 1 hour drive) to get my iPad on the 13th. The Apple Pencil was missing. Dongles came separate to the post office about 15 minutes drive from me and  Keyboard with Swedish layout had delayed shipment date but eventually came on the 18th. I could have marked “Send All Together” however this makes predicted dates of arrival longer and I wanted to have all for Xmas. I contacted DHL many times that told me “They are looking for it but for now it is lost.” I previously had bad experience with DHL in Sweden sending my iPhone to some company by mistake. Luckily the secretary was stunned and did not open the packet - so it arrived finally at my home. On the other hand UPS is much better in Sweden and I gave my feedback on it to Apple. Surprisingly now my iPhones (bought 8+ in January and Max in September) arrived by UPS. I contacted Apple Support and after many very long telephone conversations with different levels of support, feeling as if I have stolen the Apple Pencil - they sent me a new one that arrived on the 28th (predicted date was January 3rd - a month after my order!). My account was charged by Apple on December 7th. I got email from Apple that my AppleCare+ covers both the iPad and Apple Pencil. However since the new Pencil has different serial number therefore I asked Apple to change this. They told me to call again when new Pencil arrives and start the procedure. I called and first line support told me that it is not the case. I asked for higher line and it was properly corrected. This all costed me so much time. Every time giving product numbers that contain long strings of letters and numbers by phone using was frustrating. Why does Apple not do it by email? They have all my details. Amazon UK did much better job in a similar situation with just two email! Since DHL Express has not delivered the original shipment within 3 weeks it should be flagged by Apple and automatically investigated. It wasn’t. Now with prices of Apple products being so high we should demand even higher standards of service especially for such basic things as failure to deliver.

My school recently got a Google education account, and we have a few iPads for use by students if they are not able to bring their own device.  Unfortunately our school has some pretty poor password security and some students learned the admin password.  This meant spending a long part of my day deleting apps and games installed by the students.  While I would definitely like all input regarding features I should enable on the iPad, what I really want to know is this:

Is there an app or a feature that allows me to set a new ""Default"" so that if things get installed again that should not be installed, instead of doing a factory reset or deleting apps one by one I can get rid of all the apps that are not part of the default and keep the apps like Google Slides and Docs?

&gt; Ex) This information is interesting and I like looking at it. Important play count information would be accurate for potential future usage of Siri such as saying ""play my most listened to Portugal. The Man and MGMT songs"")

* No Handoff feature
- Ex) If I have a queue of songs on my Mac or Apple TV, I want to be able to quickly get that on my iPhone if I have to leave in my car to go somewhere.

* No BPM data for any songs
&gt; Ex) This would give Apple a huge edge on competitors like Spotify. BPM data is useful for creating playlists and surely Apple can figure can figure out a way to automate this entire process for every Apple Music song

* No higher tier plan for hi-fi audio ($19.99 per month)
&gt; Ex) I listen to music for hours every day. I listen to 1-7 new albums per week. I'm willing to pay extra to have hi-fidelity audio for Apple Music songs. I think the best way to do this would be to select which existing songs in my library I want to convert to hi-fi. That way play counts, date added, and playlists are all retained.

* Doesn't have end of the year stats like Spotify
&gt; Ex) If Apple figured out play counts and got it to sync properly between devices this shouldn't be hard for Apple to implement

* Improve track listing and results in Search
&gt; Ex) It's confusing when searching for songs and I get 5 results for the same song. Apple should highlight the result that is the best one. For example when I search ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" the proper album version is the sixth result. Greatest hits albums and the movie versions are ranked higher. Apple Music should at least have an option to bump the album version to the top. This is useful if you want to go back in the future and listen to more songs from that album

* Music videos aren't in great quality... So why even have them?
&gt; Ex) I think the best I have seen is 720p. If it's 1080p on YouTube why even have them on Apple Music?

* Doesn't create smart playlists based on songs I listen to frequently or during certain times of the day
&gt; Ex) I want to be able to say ""Hey Siri, play King Gizzard songs that I listen to on the way to work very early in the morning""

* Special edition albums bought in iTunes that aren't available on Apple Music don't show up on my Apple Music profile
&gt; Ex) InnerSpeaker (Collector's Edition) by Tame Impala specifically. Just make a change so anything bought in iTunes shows up in Apple Music. I don't know. I guess this isn't as important.

* Duplicate genres showing in iTunes/Music app
&gt; Ex) Give users a way to merge genres in desktop app? I have 3 genres for Hip Hop/ Rap all titled the same thing.

* If an artist uploads a single to Apple Music, removes it, then includes it with the full album, then I want the option to convert the single into the album version so that it still has my play count &amp; playlists. Same goes for reuploads and remasters of other albums
&gt; Ex) The Star Wars 1-6 soundtracks were remastered last summer and the old albums were removed from Apple Music. This messed up playlists I had. I want to be able to convert the old files to the new files while retaining playlists and other information

* I want to be able to add lengthier descriptions to my playlists (or even albums as well)
&gt; Ex) Below an album I want to write a description like ""I discovered this album in 2014 when I was friends with so and so.. etc etc) Also for playlists that I share on my Apple Music profile I want to add a lengthy description.

So I reached out to Apple about the issue and followed their order: 

1. They told me to update to Mojave - I did. Few weeks later still froze.
2. They told me to do various hardware resets. - I did few weeks later still froze. 
3. They told me to do check disk for issues. I did no issues and still froze later.
4. They told me to use a different account. I made a guest account and was working on there, and it still froze.

What the actual fuck. It's been 4 months since I bought this computer, and I've done everything they've told me and this computer still keeps freezing. No I'm not using shady apps, and no I didn't install viruses. Yet it seems like Apple is treating me like a beta tester, telling me how to further test and diagnose the problem for them, all while I am at the risk of losing important work. I've tried asking for a replacement while they look over this computer, and they've just flat out denied it. 

Today, I got a freeze once again. It's been my first freeze for the last 30 days. I actually was able to record it. I really am not looking forward to live in an *uncertainty* that it'll freeze once more. 

What do I do this situation? Should I just flat out drive to the nearest Apple store, is that better than calling and chatting with Apple's customer support like I've been doing?

78,0,"So back in November I made friends with someone who works in our local Apple store. It came around that I’m looking for a second job or a job to replace the one I currently have. She suggested to me that I apply to the Apple store and then put in a referral for me. 

One of the hiring managers came into my current job while I was working and I introduced myself, I didn’t know he was one of the hiring managers at the time. I went into the store a week or so after to follow up on the referral and ended up talking to the same hiring manger and he asked me a few questions. He told me that he was waiting for something from corporate (I wish I could remember what) and then they would get me in for an interview. I haven’t wanted to go back since then because of Christmas and how busy it’s been but I’m curious if I should follow up again at all or just wait?

I had never considered it a possibility that I could work for Apple as I have no real technical expertise in computers even though I do tinker and read a lot on the subject. I believe I’d find working for Apple pretty full filling as I enjoy helping people, teaching and coaching which seems like what a big part of working in one of the stores is. I want to pursue this possible opportunity but I also don’t want to become over zealous.

I was just interested in asking if any current or past Apple store employees might have any suggestions.

I'd been using the regular apple magic wireless keyboard and I really wanted a ten key and full size arrow keys.  I'd been eyeing [this one](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMH2LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-space-gray?fnode=4c) for a while, but I just couldn't justify the price.  My wife got me [this one for Christmas](https://satechi.net/collections/peripherals-1/products/aluminum-bluetooth-wireless-keyboard?variant=12400883073112).  It's a lot cheaper than the apple one and it's really nice but there's a couple things that I'd like to point out to anyone who is considering this keyboard.  (Side note, I just got back from the apple store for a different errand and I was playing with the apple keyboard a lot, so it's still fresh on my mind).  My wife accidentally bought me the pink one and boy let me tell you; it's very pink.  Not rose gold.  It's pink.  It's going to sit on my desk so I don't mind, but I would have preferred the gold one with those delicious black keys....Second, the key travel is very soft.  Especially after getting back from the Apple store and feeling how solid the Apple Keyboard is, it makes me a little sad.  The Satechi keys are rounded, which psychologically adds to the softness of the keystroke.  It just feels really mushy.  This isn't a horrible thing by any means, and it's really usable, but it's also really noticeable.  I'm pretty sure that the Apple keyboard uses USB C and so does this one, which is great for me since I'm moving to USB C as often as I can.  Neither of them have adjustable feet so the posture of the keyboard is what your'e going to get.  One of the biggest draw backs for me is that the Satechi uses the fn key to be able to access secondary functions such as play and pause.  Not a huge thing, but really noticeable coming from an Apple Keyboard.  A bonus to the Satechi is that it can be paired to 3 devices allowing you to use it with your Mac and iPad and another device.  Also, it's much cheaper than the Apple Keyboard.  I've only had it a few days so I can't report back on the battery life, but I figure it's better than what I had before, which was changing out batteries every so often.  Let me know if I can answer any questions about it.

5,0,"Hey guys. I was gifted a refurbished iPhone 7 for Christmas and I haven't updated it to the newest iOS yet. It's currently running 11. It looks and works like it's brand new and battery health is reading 100% (but idk how accurate that is...). Compared to my s6 the iPhone is a dream. My only issue seems to be adjusting to Apple overall as this is my first ever product from them. 

Here's my dilemma: I've been reading a ton of stuff online about iOS 12 ruining certain older iPhones. If my phone is working fine right now, should I even bother?

Unless there's a major change on the update that I need, I don't know if I want to take the risk. Any thoughts? I'd really appreciate any insight because I know next to nothing about Apple products! Thank you :)",Virgin Apple user here - Should I update my iPhone 7 to iOS 12?,"Hey guys. I was gifted a refurbished iPhone 7 for Christmas and I haven't updated it to the newest iOS yet. It's currently running 11. It looks and works like it's brand new and battery health is reading 100% (but idk how accurate that is...). Compared to my s6 the iPhone is a dream. My only issue seems to be adjusting to Apple overall as this is my first ever product from them.

50,0,"Honestly all the features of MacOS have so much potential but they just are never updated and improved upon so it is honestly so unbearably annoying. Instead they just keep putting new features and forgetting about them. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, one of the biggest reason that I bought a Mac was because of the fluidity that it had with my iPhone abut the notifications center is such a mess it doesn't even work most of the time. I also can't dismiss iMessages when I feel like it, I have to either have a banner which disappears too quickly or mark the message as read which dismisses the notification on all my devices. What if - just what if - I didn't want to reply just this second but in a minute or two but still want the notification. ""C'est Impossible"" - Tim Cook. And the Touch Bar is so useless on apps that aren't proprietary and even when it is Apples app it isn't that useful. For example the PDF viewer I actually found it useful to quickly switch between highlighting colors until it wasn't quick at all because every time you pressed the highlight color it would revert back to the mark up menu and then you had to press 3 separate buttons to get back into the highlight colors section. I mean there are some really incredibly small things as well that I can't believe no one at Apple has complained about. Like if you have two windows that each have safari tabs you can't just take a safari tab on one window and drag it to another. Instead you have to split view it add another tab and then transfer the tab over and then delete the extra tab you added. This is just ridiculous. If you are doing research or project of any kind and constantly have numerous tabs and windows open it is such a pain in the ass. Another really small thing is snapping windows to the sides. Like that is ridiculous you have to actually get a separate app for the most simple thing. Cmon.

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many things that are so great about MacOS and especially the Mac hardware , I actually really like the Touch Bar too, but there is just such a long list of things that are small annoyances that you wonder if any one at Apple uses a Mac. I mean sure it can be updated but at this point I wonder if Apple even cares and will update it to things people care about.

And the Touch Bar is so useless on apps that aren't proprietary and even when it is Apples app it isn't that useful. For example the PDF viewer I actually found it useful to quickly switch between highlighting colors until it wasn't quick at all because every time you pressed the highlight color it would revert back to the mark up menu and then you had to press 3 separate buttons to get back into the highlight colors section. I mean there are some really incredibly small things as well that I can't believe no one at Apple has complained about. Like if you have two windows that each have safari tabs you can't just take a safari tab on one window and drag it to another. Instead you have to split view it add another tab and then transfer the tab over and then delete the extra tab you added. This is just ridiculous. If you are doing research or project of any kind and constantly have numerous tabs and windows open it is such a pain in the ass. Another really small thing is snapping windows to the sides. Like that is ridiculous you have to actually get a separate app for the most simple thing. Cmon.

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many things that are so great about MacOS and especially the Mac hardware , I actually really like the Touch Bar too, but there is just such a long list of things that are small annoyances that you wonder if any one at Apple uses a Mac. I mean sure it can be updated but at this point I wonder if Apple even cares and will update it to things people care about.

&amp;#x200B;I wish Mac OS would stop implementing new features and just improve on all the features they already have."

This is going to be long, please hear me out, I’m really stressed and could use some help. English is not my first language, so please keep that in mind too. 

Two years ago, my charging port got burnt and after 4 appointments I finally got them to replace the charging port, even thought they claimed the tests didn’t show any anomalies apart from the -you know- BURNT charging port.

After the charging port got fixed, the battery stopped working properly and it started to get really hot. Hot is an understatement.

I took it to the Apple Store for the eighth time in the last  two years because I love my laptop. I took good care of it and have no idea how or why this happened. I left it there a few days ago and today they said the same thing. They run their tests and tell me the battery is not showing any signs of damage while it literally loses 4% by the minute while we talk (not being used at all). I point this out and the guy tells me it could be anything (software or hardware) and that if the tests aren’t showing anything, replacing the battery could not fix the issue. The charge for the replacement would be around $130. I would also like to get a new charger, so that would be around $210 total.

Finally the guy tells me I could send it to an authorized center that runs different and more in-depth test. They charge $575 and give you back some of the money depending on the actual charge they decide to place on your card if they discover and fix the issue. Could be more, could be less. They would call me first to confirm if I agree to the charge, but it’ll be at least $100 flat just for running the tests.

The other option would be to use my laptop as payment ($420 and I paid $3300 for it) so I could just get the exact same model for around $1200. Right after they told me this, the guy went to the back for a while and then came back to tell me it was probably impossible to get the exact same one. They also offered me a refurbished one with the same specifications for around $1900 (-420$).

What should I do? I’m an avid Apple user. I decided to try out Microsoft after my Macbook Pro died on me because of my budget at the time and I got a laptop with the exact same characteristics and it fucking sucks. I can’t do half of the work I did on my old laptop. I would love to get my old laptop back, but I’m not sure if it’s even worth it. What other options do I have?

This is my experience with the Apple service centre regarding the battery replacement. 

I’ve an old iPhone 6S Plus which even though I wasn’t using it cause of the new iPhone XS Max. I thought to give this battery replacement a try. 

After reading that post, I immediately book an appointment around 12-1AM and I was scheduled for next day at 3PM. 

I visited the service centre around 3PM and was scared to see the rush as already 7-8 guys were waiting before me who also came in Appointment schedule. I thought it would take an hour or so for someone to look out for my iPhone. 

However, the advisors were polite and fast in dealing with customers. After 30 mins or so one of the advisor called me and I told him that I need to replace the battery ( battery capacity was at 86%). He did some tests and agreed to get it replaced and went inside to some other advisor I believe to confirm if the battery is in stock. 

After few mins, he came back and told me that it’ll be replaced today itself but I’ve to wait for 30-40 mins. I agreed and all necessary forms were filled and payment was collected (₹2000 including taxes roughly $29). I thought there would be some extra taxes but it was all included in that cost. 

I went outside to eat something with my friend. While I was enjoying my food, got a call from same advisor that the battery has been replaced and I can collect it. In short, it was a great experience for me. These Apple advisors were polite and courteous even after dealing with so many customers in a day. 


PS: Be ready to deal with rush at these stores cause everyone wants to get their battery replaced. Also, just to convenience the customers, these Apple service centres across India are open on Sat-Sun too. 

TL;DR: I got my Apple iPhone 6S Plus battery replaced in India (metro city) within 40 mins. Happy Holidays! 

",Apple customer service in India.,"We usually hear about bad experiences for Apple customer service in India cause people who suffer are the only ones who generally post about it. I saw one post few days back for battery replacement on his/her iPhone X. 

This is my experience with the Apple service centre regarding the battery replacement. 

I’ve an old iPhone 6S Plus which even though I wasn’t using it cause of the new iPhone XS Max. I thought to give this battery replacement a try. 

After reading that post, I immediately book an appointment around 12-1AM and I was scheduled for next day at 3PM. 

I visited the service centre around 3PM and was scared to see the rush as already 7-8 guys were waiting before me who also came in Appointment schedule. I thought it would take an hour or so for someone to look out for my iPhone. 

However, the advisors were polite and fast in dealing with customers. After 30 mins or so one of the advisor called me and I told him that I need to replace the battery ( battery capacity was at 86%).

This isn’t an isolated cause. This isn’t an expected product defect or a rare case, it’s a flaw. It’s Apple’s flaw. 

**Remember, there’s a difference between some marginal product defects vs a product with a flawed design**. 

Remember what happened with the iPhone 6? Apple pretended that it was completely normal and ignored the issue for a while before using Series 7000 Aluminium on the 6S to make the phone more durable. This happened because Apple figured that they made a mistake with the iPhone 6, the material used to build that phone wasn’t of a durable quality apparently. The same has happened with the iPad. 

It’s so thin at this point that it bends when applied with even **normal** level of pressure. However some trolls are pretending that this issue is completely normal, it’s expected and it’s a non issue if you get it replaced.

I have a 2017 12.9” iPad Pro that I use for 2-3 hours each day for sketching, writing emails, web, etc. I absolutely love this device, but have had a severe issue over the past 18 months. 

My issue is that after about 6 months of use, my iPad’s touch screen would become more and more unresponsive. At first, it would only happen sporadically. I’d be typing, and the keyboard would miss a few keys. After a few more weeks, the touchscreen would become completely unresponsive after an hour of heavy use. Putting the device into sleep would fix it temporarily, but it would happen again after 30 mins or so. This problem would get drastically worse until the device was almost unusable. Even powering off the device and rebooting would not solve it. I did a clean install on the device (with and without restoring from backup) and the problem would get better, but reemerge over time.

Luckily, I have Applecare. I brought the device in, and Apple swapped it out for me free of charge. Then, after a few months the probably happened again. Again, I went through the same steps and got a new device from Apple. I am now on my third iPad from Apple. And the touchscreen has just started getting worse again. I’m typing this on my Smart Keyboard, because the touchscreen is barely useable right now.

A quick Google search about the topic didn't spit out many results, except this one [German pure html site](https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro/intl/de-de/diy/diy_faq_body.html), hosted on Apples domain, explaining how you can evaluate if a replacement part can fix your problem and a link to site where you can allegedly order replacement parts.

I have had nightmare experiences with Apple the passed year and today was the day that I have lost all faith in Apple. 

Let me preface this by saying Apple is no longer  a straight forward company. They love to burn your time and make you jump through hoops. 

Them handling this battery replacement program has also been a mess. I had them do my 7+ battery that I had to wait week for them to have a battery in stock, among having to send that phone into their depot literally ten times (but that’s another story) but here we are. End of the year, they knew everyone would want a battery and stock isn’t here again. 

I book my appointment a week out like a diligent person with the correct classification, and book a second appointment for my girls phone. I wait for the faithful day. The day comes and I get a call on my phone. I answer it. Oh who is it the local Apple store. They told me repairs are high and my repair will now take place over the night. No worries. 

Get to the store and here’s where the nightmare begins. I go sit down at the back and wait the additional 15 mins to be seen. A info collector comes around and confirms someone called me to let me know repair is now overnight. Still good. 

Finally the “genius” (I put it in quotes because they don’t know what they never know what they are doing). Runs the test on my phone. All is good. Frets over the tiniest crack in my screen protector. Pull it back to show her it’s not the screen, which even if that crack was in the screen would be covered under limited warranty. Okay here’s the first oof. “We have a battery but need a speaker to do the repair. You’ll have to wait until whenever to do your repair we can order parts today though.” Alright whatever I’ll jump your hoops sign me up. Next phone. My girlfriends. We do their stupid test and all mechanical points are great except my girlfriends running the public beta so fuck her. The genius gets up walks five feet does a uturn back and tells me she spoke with her manager and they can’t work on phones running the beta.  I backed up the phones I am know dummy, so I called her on the bluff she played. I said okay, let’s restore the phone then. “Oh beta support terms and agreements you signed doesn’t let me do that.” Fuck you I know it does. Apples only support for beta is to restore it back to factory. You’re just lazy and you don’t want to do the extra work. Just order my parts so I can jump your hoops and get my shit done. Nope more hoops to jump. Now I have to restore the phone, make another appointment and bring it back in. Call AppleCare when I leave to see if I can send a battery to a store like Apple was doing less than 5 months ago. Nope can’t do that. They’ll gladly send me a box to be without my phone and charge me shipping tho. Nope. No one in the history of man kind will choose that option. 

This with 3 other incidents that occurred this year just shows me the employees don’t understand or get proper training and or just straight up don’t care about their job or the customer experience.

I ordered mine around thanksgiving and it arrived a week or so later at my office. I installed the apps and used it for about 10 minutes. My work WiFi is not great so I shrugged off the bad performance (which I will describe in a little bit) and boxed up the Luna and put it in my cable bag. 

It stayed there in my cable bag until today when I remembered I had never gotten around to using it at home. 

With both latest iPad Pro 12.9 and latest 15” MacBook Pro sitting about 8 ft away from my WiFi router the performance was just as bad at the office. Scrolling lagged bad, especially with pictures. Everything turns compressed and grainy until you stop scrolling, wait a second (or more), and then it clears up. Repeat this process over and over again because you can only scroll so far with two fingers on the iPad screen. So while it was nice to have “real safari” on my iPad. The experience is so bad that I would never consider using it this way again. 

I could see using it for something static, like calendar or iMessage where scrolling is minimal but those apps are arguably better natively on the iPad and don’t require Luna at all for a second screen experience.

They had no reason to support iPhone 5s which they neither sold nor was it in Majority. They did it (imo) only cuz they wanted to and patch up iOS 11 (which they didn’t have any incentive to do)

Not trying to be ‘that’ dude, but when your toddler drops a small book (ca. 200 grams according to my shitty kitchen scale) while being juggled around your waist and it essentially turns your iPad Pro screen into a mere shadow of its original state, I can’t help but wonder if I should have spent my hard-earned savings on something other than Apple’s new “Pro” iPad and the Apple Pencil.

I’m guessing these new features are here because of the iPhone XR, but it’s nice to see Apple give these new features to old iPhones as well, also, I guess it’s a hint they might be abandoning 3D touch in the near future as well, especially since it wasn’t exactly a resounding success, at least not on iPhones. 

Tl;dr TIL that you can now use the hidden options in control center and long tap on the space bar to get a cursor on older non-3D touch phones as well. Has anyone noticed the renewed support on older iPhones for features that were previously only available on 3D touch enabled iPhones?"

18,0,"I recently had my new iPhone Xs stolen, and as with any lost device, this is very frustrating. 
I put it in lost mode within 10 minutes of the incident, but the phone was already turned off and has been until the thieves turned it on and texted the number displayed on the screen. (They sent a phishing link to compromise my Apple ID and presumably remove the phone from lost mode.)
This conveniently updated its location but also showed there was 40% battery in the phone. Of course, they turned it off immediately afterwards again. 
Now after doing some quick googling, I found out that governmental organizations such as the NSA can still track your phone despite being turned off, as long as there is battery power. 
It would seriously help if Apple could implement a feature to allow you to track a phone in lost mode, despite it being turned off, I don’t see the downsides of this.

The first thing I believe is that Android is a limiting factor for companies such as Huawei or Samsung, thanks to the simple fact they are depending on another company (in this case Google) and depending to other has some disadvantages such as a lack of software updates, security patches etc. And by making they own skin most of the time they leave the phone in a pretty cluttered way just like a sandwich... first Android, then the manufacturer and then the carrier. I don’t think that Fucsia is the future, it will be an Android 2.0 that will have the same business model that Android currently has and they will still have that sandwich which will lead to the same partition of OS Versions.

Another thing is that companies like Samsung, Huawei etc. have a bad reputation for selling cheap or mid-range phones (I don’t mean they’re bad) and that caps how well the flagship can sell, other thing that doesn’t help is selling two flagships at different times of the year (as an example S series on the beginning and the Note at fall) and all these thing lead to discounts of flagships that have a terrible value if you buy them when they launch because 3 months in and the phone costs $699 instead of the $1000 that it cost at launch. It’s pretty obvious that Samsung tries two things at the same time... one is selling top tier flagships and the other is selling phones to the masses, and this is pretty clear when you enter their page, first the flagship and then the cheap phone. It’s the same issue that KIA and Hyundai have in the US, they’re appreciated as bad cars but maybe they aren’t bad cars. And the same applies to Huawei, they’re trying to fix their reputation but they still selling cheap phones.

And this brings me to the main point, no other company follows the same path as Apple. It’s stupid simple, make 3 keynotes for 3 different kind of products... 1 for computers/tablets, 1 for software and 1 for phones. That’s basically Apple’s schedule every damn year. Also Apple marketing is stupid simple, just focus on your phone and glance others but make your phone unique.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got a 2013 macbook pro that was a donation, so I'm not the original owner or anything. I had an issue where the macbook was randomly shutting down on me. I took it to the apple store as when I chatted with a rep they said checking the laptop was free, so I figured even if I can't afford to fix it (I knew it would be pricey no matter how small) I might as well check it. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the diagnostic the person who handled it, damaged my backspace key, I was standing on his left, he was on my right, and on his right was a fellow apple genius-person. I guess we had taken the coworkers spot because there was a macbook in front of me, I had just followed my apple adviser. So he folded the macbook, to hand to his coworker, he picked it up and as it passed over my macbook he must of lost his grip, it fell, and he caught it just in time but the corner sort of kissed my backspace key. He said he caught it in the nick of time and it looked that way then. 

&amp;#x200B;

They ran some diagnostic, and it froze during the test. The guy was surprised and said he didn't expect any issues truthfully so he asked to run extended tests and I said sure, I even said to wipe it if need be. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I got it today, they said since extended tests didn't show anything they didn't bother wiping and wrote the problem wasn't replicated or seen during testing and just let me go on my way. I was happy but I tested my macbook before leaving, the backspace is depressed, it won't come up. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's the holidays so the guy who gave it to me had left as soon as I signed the ipad. But he wasn't the tech who worked on it anyway so nothing I could have said but I'm wondering how to go about reporting this? My concern is from the outside I have a macbook, out of warranty, that I have no record of having even purchased myself, and it might look like I'm trying to raise issues for some freebies.

Build quality and longevity seem so good (heard also battery?), people seem to routinely use them for a fair few years with no issues which is pretty amazing.

Thing is I've been trying to do research on Macs and the lineup seems quite complicated tbh. For background, I'm a grad student in the sciences. I don't do a lot. I type up things, read documents, netflix, and obviously reddit sort of things. There might be a couple of bio softwares I might use that are available on Mac OS (I've checked). I've heard from people in my program say I may need to use things like Photoshop to make figures and things like that with my data. I'm aware there's a learning curve, but I'm up for it. Everyone in my lab except me uses a Mac so that will be helpful.

My question was the non-touchbar Macbook Pro vs. the touchbar Macbook Pro. The touchbar seems cool, but honestly not sure how much I'll reach my hand over and click it. Like I feel like I won't use it. It's kind of like a touchscreen laptop, I have it, but do I really use the touchscreen, nah. The thing is I noticed that apparently you need to get the touchbar one to have the 8th generation processors? I read that you really need to get the 8th gen? And something about the touchbar version having quad core. I'll be honest, I'm not well versed on computers to know what is necessary.

I'm looking at the 13 inch because the 15 inch is ridiculously expensive. Also I rather have something portable to lab, to class, and home.

I have no real worries, except the keyboard. A good friend suggested I go to the store and try the keyboard out because he said it wasn't what he was expecting. My concern isn't so much getting used to it, but I heard the third generation keyboards still have dust problems? Can anyone shed some light on whether it's a concern? I eat while using my laptop, so I'm concerned. Like it's on my desk and I eat pasta or something, I'm not eating over it or anything I'm a pretty clean person.

Lot of text, but yea wanted to give some info.

Thanks everybody for listening and hope everyone is enjoying the holidays.","Making the switch to Apple, questions on Macs.","Hi,

I’ve had the app downloaded for awhile without using it, I guess it was passively logging my sleep sessions so that accounts for the last week.

I finally opened and set up the app last night, I looked through all the settings and didn’t see anything that suggested that my alarms set with the iPhone clock app would be silenced. But THEN, I woke up this morning at 7:45. The exact time that I was supposed to be clocking in to work! Thankfully I had no patients scheduled until 9:30 this morning so it was okay. 

Is there something I missed or should I disable this app? All THREE of my alarms set between 5:45 and 6:30 were disabled. I want to use this app because it seems way easier to use than Pillow and provides more info but if I can’t fix this then it’s a no-go.

I can't decide whether to buy it or not. I'm currently studying design at school. I've also started working as a graphic designer some time ago.

I mostly use Adobe Creative Apps for magazine, books, covers and Logo design. I also like web design.

I was considering to buy a iPad Pro because I really like drawing and improving at hand lettering. What keeps me on the fence is that I've always worked without it and drawing would probably be just a hobby, maybe I'll drop it because I don't have time. 

Moreover the only direct link to my job could be that of logo design, since everything else could be done on paper and digitally designed with my Mac and Creative Cloud Apps.


What do you think? Is the iPad pro something that could help me in my daily job and school?

Ps: I'm definitely not going to take notes with it. I won't ever be able to stop using paper for that :)

So I pretty much went [here](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/15-inch-space-grey-2.6ghz-6-core-512gb#), entered my zipcode and noticed that the default build will arrive Dec 28th. Some MBPs with upgrades are probably not available with the same delivery date, while others are.

For example, if I upgrade the CPU to an i9, SSD to 1T and GPU to Vega 20, it will remain Dec 28th, because I guess they have it in stock.

However, that is too expensive for me, and I don't require an i9 (I also hear they heat way more). I looked it up and it seems like the Vega 20 is way better (and also runs cooler) than the 560X, and so I'd really like to get that. However, any build combination with the i7 that includes the Vega 20, bumps the delivery date to the 9th, the earliest. I tried any combinations with the Vega 20 and i7 with 16GB/32GB RAM, 512GB/1T SSD, etc, to no avail...

Which is why I'm asking - how accurate is the delivery date? Pickup is not an option what so ever - it has to be delivered to me, and as I said - I won't be here after Jan 5th.

Am I pretty much SOL? I tried asking via live chat, but as expected, they're obviously off atm (Christmas).

Thanks :(","I'm leaving Canada Jan 5th and according to the estimated delivery times, a custom MBP will arrive Jan 9th, the earliest. How accurate is it?","Hey guys,

From the positive response of my previous post (2006 MacBook Pro) here is my Gen. 3 iPod from 2004. It came with a wall charger, dock, carrying case (long gone), and wired remote (also gone) - very rare thing for Apple to do. This one could only be charged via FireWire, was the only iPod with light up buttons, the first to work on Windows, and was the first device to feature the 30 pin ""Dock"" connector - which carried out throughout the iPods lifespan along with the first few iPhones.

I took my graduation money from high school (yeah, brilliant move) and bought this exactly one month before the much more famous 4 Gen iPod with Clock Wheel came out. 

Also ""preserved"" is the receipt and store pamphlets - not just for the 2003 iPod lineup but the very first gen iPod, as well (which I vaguely remember obtaining at a store now defunct called ""CompUSA.""

What makes it even more depressing is how people belittle those who don't have the latest phone.

Somebody called me poor because I told them I didn't want to buy the XR. I mean... why? Because I've chosen to not spend over $700-$1000 on the one thing, I'm apparently poor? It's a mentality I just can't wrap my head around, but that's neither here nor there.
